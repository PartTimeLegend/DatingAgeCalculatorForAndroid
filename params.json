I will therefore be accepting donations towards the purchase of a new machine.\r\n\r\nBTC: [1CdzakhzxS5QMfe9bM6KZapNWbFtfNKimx](bitcoin:1CdzakhzxS5QMfe9bM6KZapNWbFtfNKimx) | TRC: [1HgyXPsAhyD6wCGqp5Ntgq8549XkWTauvG](terracoin:1HgyXPsAhyD6wCGqp5Ntgq8549XkWTauvG) | LTC: [LRqjHkL5wFt9JxE5vmHGcxNCbqQMvyEJY5](litecoin:LRqjHkL5wFt9JxE5vmHGcxNCbqQMvyEJY5)\r\n\r\nOkay, I'll also take [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=G2M23XDAB8HBA)\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDating Age Calculator For Android\r\n=================================\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago I devised a simple mathematical equation for determining the acceptable age difference between romantic partners.\r\n\r\nI did have a site written in PHP that received a lot of traffic with people entering their ages and seeing the range.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I lost the source code for the site and I never bothered to rewrite and deploy. I have built this as an Android application.\r\n\r\nFormula\r\n-------\r\n\r\n`x = Your age`\r\n\r\n`y = Minimum age`\r\n\r\n`(x / 2) + 7 = y`\r\n\r\nSo to use this equation I will use my own age of 27 at this time.\r\n\r\n`(27 / 2) + 7 = 20.5`\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER\r\n==========\r\nThis is a theoretical equation and should not be used as part of a legal defence. You should use your best judgement and not do anything illegal.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
