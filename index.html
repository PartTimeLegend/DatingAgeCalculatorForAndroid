          <h1>ANNOUNCEMENT</h1>

<p>Unfortunately my computer has died and due to a lack of continous employment over the recent months I am currently unable to purchase a replacement machine at this point.</p>

<p>I will therefore no longer be developing this software until I am able to purchase a replacement.</p>

<p>It is always a little rude to ask for donations, but as I am developing this software free of charge for everyone to use. I will therefore be accepting donations towards the purchase of a new machine.</p>

<p>Okay, I'll also take <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=G2M23XDAB8HBA">PayPal</a></p>

<hr><h1>Dating Age Calculator For Android</h1>

<p>Several years ago I devised a simple mathematical equation for determining the acceptable age difference between romantic partners.</p>

<p>I did have a site written in PHP that received a lot of traffic with people entering their ages and seeing the range.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I lost the source code for the site and I never bothered to rewrite and deploy. I have built this as an Android application.</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p><code>x = Your age</code></p>

<p><code>y = Minimum age</code></p>

<p><code>(x / 2) + 7 = y</code></p>

<p>So to use this equation I will use my own age of 27 at this time.</p>

<p><code>(27 / 2) + 7 = 20.5</code></p>

<hr><h1>DISCLAIMER</h1>

<p>This is a theoretical equation and should not be used as part of a legal defence. You should use your best judgement and not do anything illegal.</p>
