ANNOUNCEMENT
============

Unfortunately my computer has died and due to a lack of continous employment over the recent months I am currently unable to purchase a replacement machine at this point.

I will therefore no longer be developing this software until I am able to purchase a replacement.

It is always a little rude to ask for donations, but as I am developing this software free of charge for everyone to use. I will therefore be accepting donations towards the purchase of a new machine.

Dating Age Calculator For Android
=================================

Several years ago I devised a simple mathematical equation for determining the acceptable age difference between romantic partners.

I did have a site written in PHP that received a lot of traffic with people entering their ages and seeing the range.

Unfortunately I lost the source code for the site and I never bothered to rewrite and deploy. I have built this as an Android application.

Formula
-------

`x = Your age`

`y = Minimum age`

`(x / 2) + 7 = y`

So to use this equation I will use my own age of 27 at this time.

`(27 / 2) + 7 = 20.5`

DISCLAIMER

This is a theoretical equation and should not be used as part of a legal defence. You should use your best judgement and not do anything illegal.
