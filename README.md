Dating Age Calculator For Android
=================================

Several years ago I devised a simple mathematical equation for determining the acceptable age difference between romantic partners.

I did have a site written in PHP that received a lot of traffic with people entering their ages and seeing the range.

Unfortunately I lost the source code for the site and I never bothered to rewrite and deploy. I have built this as an Android application.

Formula
-------

`x = Your age`

`y = Minimum age`

`(x / 2) + 7 = y`

So to use this equation I will use my own age of 27 at this time.

`(27 / 2) + 7 = 20.5`
